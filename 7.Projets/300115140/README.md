# How to send automatic emails notifications using Ansible

**A - Introduction**


Writing shell programs(also known as scripts) is one of the best strategy for gaining time. Once I write a shell program, I can go back at it as many times as needed. I can also update my shell scripts in between releases, installing new software, changing what I want or need to accomplish with the script. I can also easely add new functions, removing obsolete functions, and fixing bugs. These kinds of changes are just part of the maintenance cycle for any type of code.
